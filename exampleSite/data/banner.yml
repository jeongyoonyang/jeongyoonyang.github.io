  Hello! I’m Jeongyoon — you can call me <strong>Jenny</strong>. I’m a first-year master’s student in Communication at <a target="_blank" href="https://devcms.yonsei.ac.kr/mcc/index.do">Yonsei University</a>.
  <br>My research focuses on how polarization shapes academic knowledge and how inclusive research practices can foster better understanding. 
  <br>I earned a double B.A. in Communication and Education Studies - Research and Policy from the University of Washington, Seattle.
  <br><br>Through my international experiences, I have developed a strong interest in multiculturalism and how people from diverse backgrounds communicate and learn from one another.
